# CodePen is awesome!

![](/images/codepen.png)

For quite some time it's pretty normal to use something like [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) to visualize frontend ideas
or provide solutions to a JavaScript question asked by some desperate lad over at stackoverflow. It's just more convenient to hack something up directly in the
browser, but to edit HTML/CSS/JS locally and put it online somewhere.

Recently I've stumbled upon a similar service, called [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) and was immediately sold by two key factors.

1. It's beautiful, yet functional
2. It's a community of creative coders

I love the idea of sharing and improving ideas within a community of creatives.
At first glance the [homepage of CodePen](http://codepen.io/) even looks a bit like [dribble](http://dribbble.com/) and it kinda is the same thing – a place to show off cool stuff.
The difference is, that with CodePen you may click on each of those visual gems and fork it. Just like that. Fork it, extend it, share it.

It's a great way to try out new stuff, toy around and see what others do. Personally I'm trying to do *something fresh* on Codepen every week or so. [Feel free to follow me](http://codepen.io/saibotd).

I believe it is important to be able to show and share what's possible within *The Web* as an interactive medium. I'm getting tired of design only taking place in static mockups, which later on may – or may not – be *made interactive*.

Animation and interactivity in a modern web application shouldn't be an afterthought.

CodePen is a great utility to emphasize that coders, just like graphic designers, can and should be creative about the medium they work with.

# Stop scratching

Some of the worlds greatest software has come to life because someone had an itch. They [scratched that itch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Genesis) by developing some piece of software, others picked it up an iterated upon it, and so on.

I'm not saying that I've too written some of the greatest stuff ever (yet), but I have my fair share of itches that I try to address within the scope of my abilities. Take [Mímir](https://github.com/saibotd/mimir) for example. I wanted to keep my notes in a flat file format, yet be able to write stuff in a nice UI which also works on mobile devices. So I did just that. I've picked a stack (Python/Flask) and hacked away. I've learned a lot in the progress and in the end I've got the application I've dreamed of - Perfect!

But yet, I'm not satisfied. Every other time I actually use Mímir for what I've intended it for, I end up improving the application itself instead of my content. It's a really frustrating habit of seeing little bugs and room for improvements in my software. Right now (I am using Mímir to write this very post) I'm thinking about the urgent necessity of a full-text search – *ugh*. 

I'll try hard to focus more on the task at hand and stop scratching once the itch is mostly gone. On the other hand, Linus Torvalds never stopped scratching his itch – not being able to purchase a MINIX license over 20 years ago. So yeah, we have that.
